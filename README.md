This project was done with an idea to create a Todo list website where different streams works can be logged and removed according to users convinience.
This works with mongoDB assistence which should be running back in the terminal in order for the database to work. The website isn't deployed yet, it can only be used in 
the local server. Use nodemon with the javascript file for deploying the website locally.
